Solutions to Kiwi Pycon 2014 codewars problems.

Dear CodeMaster - you have a diabolical mind!

My initial tools were a text editor and ipython3 shell,
and of course the internet!

I didn't go for complete one-shot programs that spit out the solution,
as often the eyeball is faster than code for one-off things.

The "file" utility came in very useful for identifying the various
binary file formats, and I guess I have seen enough to guess what
uuencoded and base64 encoded text look like.

For problems 3,4 and 6 I ended up using python2 because of the availability
of more packaged libraries on my system.

E.g. _slate_ for problem 3 part 2
